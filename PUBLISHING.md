# Publishing Guide

This document explains how to version and publish the Ack packages to pub.dev.

## Overview

The Ack project uses GitHub Releases to manage versioning and publishing. This approach provides:

- Centralized release management through GitHub's UI
- Explicit version/changelog control in this repository
- Automated publishing to pub.dev

## Release Process

### 1. Prepare for Release

Before creating a release:

1. Ensure all changes are committed and pushed to the `main` branch
2. Verify that all tests pass by running `dart run melos run test` (include `dart run melos run validate-jsonschema` and `dart run melos run test:gen` for full coverage)
3. Check that the documentation is up to date across the repo and docs site
4. Decide on the new version number following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and apply it consistently to every publishable package (`ack`, `ack_annotations`, `ack_generator`, `ack_firebase_ai`, `ack_json_schema_builder`)
5. Ensure package CHANGELOG entries are finalized before tagging. If you want a link-only entry for a version, you can run `dart scripts/update_release_changelog.dart <version> [tag]` after `dart run melos version`.

### 2. Create a GitHub Release

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/conceptadev/ack/releases) in the repository
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Create a new tag in the format `v0.2.0` (must start with "v")
4. Add a title, e.g., "Release v0.2.0"
5. Add detailed release notes with a structure like:

```markdown
# Release v0.2.0

This release introduces [brief description of major changes].

## Key Features
- **Feature 1**: Description
- **Feature 2**: Description

## Breaking Changes
- **Feature**: Description of breaking change
  - Detail 1
  - Detail 2

## Improvements

## Bug Fixes

```

> **Note**: You should manually update the `pubspec.yaml` and `CHANGELOG.md` files in each package before creating a tag/release. The release workflow publishes what is already committed.

6. Choose whether this is a pre-release:
   - Check "This is a pre-release" if you're releasing a beta or RC version
   - Pre-releases WILL be published to pub.dev as pre-release versions
   - Only draft releases won't be published to pub.dev

7. Click "Publish release"

### 3. Automated Steps

When the `v*` tag is pushed, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:

1. Test and publish the independent `ack` and `ack_annotations` foundation
   packages.
2. After both hosted versions are available, test and publish `ack_generator`.
3. After the generator stage completes, test and publish
   `ack_json_schema_builder` and `ack_firebase_ai`.
4. Run `dart pub publish --dry-run` immediately before each package upload.

This staging is required for coordinated releases because workspace resolution
uses local packages, while published consumers resolve the hosted versions. The
local reusable workflow calls are deliberately sequential so each dependent
package resolves the foundation version published by the preceding stage. Its
external actions are commit-pinned, and its pinned Flutter archive is verified
against a checked-in SHA-256 value before execution.

The workflow does **not** modify versions or changelogs, and does **not** commit changes back to the repository.

### 4. Verify the Release

After the workflow completes:

1. Check that the packages are available on pub.dev
2. Verify that the version numbers and changelogs are correct
3. Test the published packages in a new project to ensure they work as expected

## Alternative: Manual Versioning

If needed, you can version packages locally from conventional commits:

```bash
# Propose/apply version and changelog updates
dart run melos version

# Non-interactive
dart run melos version --yes

# Push the changes and tags
git push --follow-tags
```

## Manual Publishing

If you need to publish packages manually:

```bash
# Dry-run each package (validation only)
for pkg in ack ack_annotations ack_generator ack_json_schema_builder ack_firebase_ai; do
  (cd packages/$pkg && dart pub publish --dry-run) || exit 1
done

# Actual publish (no dry-run)
dart run melos run publish
```

## Troubleshooting

### Release Workflow Fails

If the release workflow fails, check:

1. **Test Failures**: Fix any failing tests or analyze issues
2. **Version Issues**: Check if the version is valid and follows semantic versioning
3. **Permission Issues**: Ensure the GitHub Actions workflow has the necessary permissions
4. **Git Issues**: There might be problems with pushing commits back to the repository

### Manual Publishing Issues

If manual publishing fails:

1. **Authentication**: Ensure you're logged in to pub.dev with `dart pub login`
2. **Version Conflicts**: Check if the version already exists on pub.dev
3. **Dependency Issues**: Verify that all dependencies are correctly specified

## Version Numbering

The Ack project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major version (x.0.0)**: Incompatible API changes
- **Minor version (0.x.0)**: Backwards-compatible functionality additions
- **Patch version (0.0.x)**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes

For pre-releases, use formats like `0.2.0-beta.1` or `0.2.0-rc.1`.
